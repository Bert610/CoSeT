# CoSeT
Tools that support competitive selection processes (e.g., grant selection, hackathons ...).

CoSeT is largely contained with one MS Excel workbook. This includes 23 worksheets and 11 macro functions.
There is an acompanying guide document (MS Word).
Also in the repository are one or more sample data sets for learning about CoSeT

About the current version (V5h):
- runs with sample data sets
- issues to improve include:
   large file size
   fixed limits on projects (1000), markers (500), keywords (30), criteria (30)
   slow processing speed 
   competition workbook created too late in workflow
   uses Active-X macro buttons so not compatible with Mac version of Excel.
