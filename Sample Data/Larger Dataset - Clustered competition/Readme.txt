The competition workbook in this folder has been set up as an example of a clustered competition, 
as described in appendix D of CoSeT - The Guide.

For simplicity there is only one keyword per cluster.  

The Marker Expertise table has been set up to have the expertise row near zero for most clusters.  

Try adjusting the Marker Expertise table and see how leads to changes in the Projects X Markers table 
and the subsequent assignments. See if you can get rid of most of the low expertise assignments 
(confidence levels 1 in columns J through M) by editing the Marker Expertise table:
1. Moving ‘H’s
2. Adding a few ‘H’s as necessary
3. Adding M’s  

Remember to run the ‘Populate Project X Marker table’ and ‘Make Assignments’ macros to see the 
results of your changes.

Note, the fewer H and M letters added, the more ‘clustered’ the competition will be for markers.
